<h1>C - argc, argv</h1>
</br>

<p>At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to use arguments passed to your program</li>
<li>What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other</li>
<li>How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters</li>
</ul>
