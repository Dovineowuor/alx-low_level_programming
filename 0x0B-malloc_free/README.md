<h1>C - malloc, free</h1>

<h2>This section is a practice on assigning dynamic and Automatic memory space to files.<//h2>

<p>At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation in C</li>
<li>What is malloc and free and how to use them</li>
<li>How to use valgrind to check for memory leak</li>
</u>

<p>...The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h</p>
