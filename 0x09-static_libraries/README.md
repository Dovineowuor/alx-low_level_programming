<h1>C - Static and dynamic libraries</h1>
</break>

<p>At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it</li>
<li>Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm</li>
<li>Creating A Static “C” Library Using “ar” and “ranlib”</li>
<li>What is difference between Dynamic and Static library(Static and Dynamic linking)</li>
<li>...a simple C library suing ranlib</li>
</ul>

<p>also create an executable script that creates a dynamic C library from the commands inside of it</p>
